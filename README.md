# Online School
Project I did for my "Platforms for Object-oriented programming" class for my college (third semestar)

# Install / Start
First you will need to clone this repository.
Make database with createTable.sql schema which is in Scripts folder, and you will probably need to change connection string in Config.cs.

# This is how project looks
